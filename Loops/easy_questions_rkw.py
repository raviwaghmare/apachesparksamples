'''
For Loops:
-Using a for loop, print numbers from 1 to 5.
-Iterate through a list my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] and print each element.
-Create a dictionary my_dict with some key-value pairs and iterate through its keys, printing each key.
-Iterate through a string 'Python' and print each character.

If-Else Statements:
-Write an if-else statement to check if num1 is greater than num2. Print 'True' if it is, otherwise 'False'.
-Create a variable temperature with a value and write an if-else statement to check if the temperature is above 30. Print 'Hot' if it is, otherwise 'Not hot'.
-Check if a number num is even or odd using an if-else statement. Print 'Even' or 'Odd' accordingly.
-Write an if-else statement to determine if a string my_string contains the letter 'a'. Print 'Contains' if it does, otherwise 'Not found'.

While Loops:
-Using a while loop, print numbers from 1 to 5.
-Create a variable counter and initialize it with 0. Write a while loop to print the square of numbers from 1 to 5.
-Implement a while loop that prints the Fibonacci series up to 10 terms.
-Write a while loop to find the factorial of a number n.
