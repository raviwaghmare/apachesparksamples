### For Loops:

1. Use a for loop to find and print all prime numbers between `1` and `50`.
2. Iterate through a list `my_list = [4, 7, 2, 9, 5]` and find the sum of all even numbers in the list using a for loop.
3. Create a nested loop to print a pattern like below:
   ```
   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   ***** 
   ```

### If-Else Statements:

1. Write a program to simulate a grading system. Ask the user to input marks and print the corresponding grade using if-else statements.
2. Implement a program that checks if a string entered by the user is a palindrome or not using if-else statements.
3. Create a function that checks if a given year is a leap year. Use an if-else statement to handle the condition.

### While Loops:

1. Write a program using a while loop to generate the Fibonacci series up to `n` terms, where `n` is input by the user.
2. Create a guessing game where the computer generates a random number between `1` and `100`, and the user tries to guess it. Use a while loop to continue until the user guesses correctly.
3. Use a while loop to print a countdown from `10` to `1` and then print 'Happy New Year!'.
